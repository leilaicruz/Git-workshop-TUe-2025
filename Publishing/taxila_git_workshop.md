**Date:** 10 - 11 March 2025


**Timezone:** Amsterdam



**Language of instruction:** English


Join us for a two-day workshop for **PhD students, postdocs, and researchers at TU/e**. Based on carpentry training materials, this hands-on workshop will introduce participants to the fundamentals of version control using Git. In the afternoon of the second day, we will conclude with a session on the 4TU ResearchData repository system.


## Who should attend?

- Researchers looking to manage their code and documentation more effectively.
- Those interested in collaborative software development.
- Anyone curious about enhancing their research with version control.

## Workshop goals:

We aim to equip the 4TU.ResearchData community with basic version control skills to improve the efficiency and reproducibility of their software projects. We will demonstrate key concepts through a simple Python script. Note that executing the script is not essential to the workshop's core objectives.

## Requirements:

No prior experience with Python is necessary, though it is beneficial.
